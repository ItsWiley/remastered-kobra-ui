# Ancubic Kobra Dark UI
A dark and improved UI for the Anycubic Kobra 3d printer

### Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any damage or malfunction caused to your printer because of those files. Any modding made to your printer is made at your own risk, this includes any damage that could happen in real life.

### Description
I happened to use the printer quite often in the dark and the default white UI was occasionally killing my soul so I decided to make this improved dark UI. It provides better translations, more explicit buttons and much more...

### Features
- Brand new UI look with a dark theme
- Starting animation shortened to remove the fading to white
- Improved buttons placements and size (bigger buttons for those who were too small and hard to tap)
- Improved translations for less ambiguity
- Much better image compression for less artifacts (The default UI was really bad)

### Known issues
- The file selection menu text becomes blue after being deselected instead of white
- The number input page input text is blue instead of white
- The UI is only available in english, the language button was disabled

### Other things to know
I am not sure if providing all the information to make your own modded UI is a good idea, for now, if you really want to you can contact me and I will give you the key elements to make your own.
